Introduction

This report provides information pertaining to the 2012 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) assessment of undiscovered, technically recoverable conventional oil and gas resources of the world, exclusive of the United States (U.S. Geological Survey World Conventional Resources Assessment Team, 2012). Some of the results were previously published, mostly in USGS fact sheet series (appendix 1).

This readme file describes the 2012 world assessment data files in this report. Unique files are those for which there is only one file of that type and include mostly summaries of input or results. There are also multiple files, for which there exists more than one file of that type. These files are either one file per assessment unit (AU) or one file per assessment unit that has been quantitatively assessed.

		Full Monte Carlo output files (“em” followed by assessment unit number followed by “.pdf”)

The unique files are available in two formats: Microsoft Excel files (.xlsx) and tab-delimited files (.tab). Because the fractiles workbooks have multiple worksheets, each worksheet is a separate tab-delimited file.
