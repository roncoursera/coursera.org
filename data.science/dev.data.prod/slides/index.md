## Climate Outcomes

1. How much will CO2 emission warm the earth
$$latex
\Delta = ECS/3.7 * 5.35 * ln(CO2_new/CO2_old) 
$$
2. Depends on how much additional CO2 is emitted
3. Depends on how sensitive (ECS) the global climate is to CO2

## CO2 Emissions: The Known Knowns

1. ~200 PPMV already emitted since pre-industrial era.
2. Burning all proved fossil fuels would raise CO2 by about another 350 PPM.
3. Oceans absorb about 50% of emissions.
4. So total increase could be ~275 PPMV, nearly doubling pre-industrial CO2.
