### Climate Outcomes

How much will future CO2 emissions warm the earth?

$$latex
\Delta = \{frac}{ECS}{3.7} * 5.35 * ln(\frac{CO2_new}{CO2_old}) 
$$

1. Depends on how much additional CO2 is emitted
2. Depends on how sensitive (ECS) the global climate is to CO2

### CO2 Emissions: The Known Knowns

1. ~200 PPMV already emitted since pre-industrial era.
2. Burning all proved fossil fuels would raise CO2 by about another 350 PPM.
3. Oceans absorb about 50% of emissions.
4. So total increase could be ~275 PPMV, nearly doubling pre-industrial CO2.

### The Known Unknowns in Fossil Fuels

But what about potential increases in proved resources?
New Discoveries. Rising Prices. Improved Technologies.
